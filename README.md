### 3D Genome Viewer
-------------
A 3D genome viewer that can observe and interact with gene sequence in 3D space.

Source code of full project will not be posted due to the project is still under active development. For professors who would need a deeper look into it, I would be able to send the full code upon request .(Around 10GB so will share using mega.nz).


My main works:

- Designed and built an interactive stand-alone file manager under Unity for the 3D genome viewer project.
- File upload and storage feature.
- Selecting menu when interacting with genome.

The related code above are in the  "Assets/3DGV_V4/UploadManager" folder
